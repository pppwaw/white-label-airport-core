# Project Overview
- Purpose: Cross-platform core for the Hiddify privacy client, producing the `libcore` shared library and `HiddifyCli` binary plus the browser-based extension runtime.
- Tech stack: Go 1.23+ with Cobra CLI, gomobile bindings, gRPC/protobuf definitions, Node tooling (browserify, grpc-web) for the extension UI, plus Docker/OpenWRT packaging assets.
- Structure: `cmd/` holds CLI commands (connect, parse, config, warp, extension, etc.); `cli/` contains the `main.go` entry that delegates to `cmd`. `custom/` defines desktop bindings built into shared libraries, while `mobile/` has gomobile glue. `extension/` contains the extension SDK, HTML demo, RPC stubs, and server harness. `hiddifyrpc/` + `protos/` store protobuf definitions, compiled via `make protos`. `docker/`, `wrt/`, and `bridge/` package the core for containers, OpenWRT, and bridge devices. `assets/` stores icons/UI artifacts, `bin/` receives build outputs, and `utils/`, `config/`, `v2/` hold helper packages and default configs.
- Entrypoints: Running `./cmd.sh <command>` (or `go run --tags ... ./cli`) executes the CLI. Shared libraries for desktop/mobile are produced through the Makefile targets (e.g., `linux-amd64`, `android`, `ios`). Extensions are served through `extension/server` and surfaced in every platform build.
